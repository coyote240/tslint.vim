INTRODUCTION																												*jshint*

This plugin is a front for tslint.

Based almost entirely upon jslint.vim by Andreas WÃ¥lm.
https://github.com/walm/jshint.vim

This plugin will allow you to run tslint from vim, and shows the results
in a split window.

:TSLint {file}

	Test {file} with tslint.
	If {file} not provided it uses current file.

	Behaves just like the |:grep| command, but will open the |Quickfix|
	window for you.

Press 'q' to close |Quickfix| window.
